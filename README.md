There are three files which are solutions of three assignments :
1. Python file - towerHeight.py - which accept integer values and output should just be the count of total combinations.

2. Python file - lsal.py - which outputs count of files + directories as integer value, name of the file/directory supports non-ascii characters, size of the file in KB and created date.

3. HTML file - date.html - where if a user enters a date in the input fields and clicks ‘Submit’, the result displayed will be next day/date.
